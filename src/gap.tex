\section{Example - Generalized assignment problem}

In the generalized assignment problem (GAP), there is a set $J = [n]$ of jobs, a set
$M = [m]$ of machines and a set $E \subseteq M \times J$ of feasible assignments.
Each $e \in E$ has an associated cost $c_e$ and a processing time $p_e$.
We are also given the availability $T_i$ for each $i \in M$.
We have to assign each job $j$ to a machine $\sigma(j)$ such that
the total load on every machine $i$ (i.e. sum of processing times of jobs assigned to machine $i$)
is at most $T_i$.

We can view $J$, $M$ and $E$ as a bipartite graph.
Let $\delta(v)$ denote the set of neighbors of vertex $v$.
We will assume WLoG that $(i, j) \in E$ implies that $p_{i,j} \le T_i$.
Also, let $q_i = \max_{j \in \delta(i)} p_{i,j}$.

The canonical LP relaxation for the GAP problem as given by \cite{lrs-book} is
\[ \begin{array}{*4{>{\displaystyle}l}}
\min_x & \sum_{e \in E}{c_e}{x_e} & &
\\ \\ \textrm{where} & \sum_{i \in \delta(j)} x_{i,j} = 1 & \quad \forall j \in J
& \quad \textrm{(each job is scheduled)}
\\ \\ & \sum_{j \in \delta(i)} p_{i,j} x_{i,j} \le T_i & \quad \forall i \in M
& \quad \textrm{(load is at most the availability)}
\\ \\ & x_e \ge 0 & \quad \forall e \in E
\end{array} \]
Let $x^*$ be an optimal solution to this LP.
