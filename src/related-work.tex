\section{Related Work}

There has been extensive work on `dependent rounding techniques',
which are rounding algorithms that also guarantee concentration properties.

In \cite{bansal19rounding}, Bansal noted that it is not clear how sub-isotropic rounding
can be applied to the Survivable Network Design Problem (SNDP),
for which a 2-approx iterative rounding algorithm was given by Jain \cite{jain-sndp}.
Recently, Lau and Zhou came up with a spectral rounding technique for solving
SNDP with concentration \cite{spectral-rounding}.

It may be fruitful to investigate problems to which we can add useful soft constraints
and whether we can get good-enough concentration for them.
