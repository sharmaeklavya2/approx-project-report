\section{Bad example for randomized iterative rounding}\label{bad-example-for-rand-itr}
Consider the problem of maximum-weight perfect bipartite matching in a cycle graph $G=C_n$,
where $n$ is even and $E = E_o \cup E_e$ with the graph consisting of alternate edges
from $E_o$ and $E_e$.
Let $w: E \mapsto R^+$ be such that $E_o$ are light edges (of weight 1)
and $E_e$ are heavy edges with some large weight. Let soft constraints be
that we have to include at least $n/4$ light edges and $n/4$ heavy edges.

Note that there is no integral solution which satisfies the soft constraints.
In fact, the only possible integral solutions are either the heavy edges only or the light edges only.
The only possible fractional solution to this LP is the one where each edge is half-selected.
Therefore, randomized iterative rounding returns each integral solution with probability half.
Since the objective value of these integral solutions are far apart,
concentration cannot be achieved.
