A common approach to designing approximation algorithms is to round a solution
of a linear programming relaxation of the problem.
Two very common approaches are randomized rounding and iterative rounding.
Recently, Nikhil Bansal came up with an algorithm, called sub-isotropic rounding
\cite{bansal19rounding}, which combines the strengths of both these techniques.
Here we give an overview of these rounding techniques and their relative merits.
We also compare these techniques on the GAP problem.
