A common approach to designing approximation algorithms is to round a solution
of a linear programming relaxation of the problem.
Recently, Nikhil Bansal devised an algorithm, called sub-isotropic rounding
\cite{bansal19rounding}, which combines the strengths of two well-known
rounding techniques: randomized rounding and iterative rounding.
Here we give an overview of these rounding techniques and compare them on the GAP problem.

We'll also review a rounding-based algorithm by Lovett and Meka \cite{12lovettmeka}
for the discrepancy-minimization problem.
